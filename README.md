# ‚òÄÔ∏è Solar Irradiance Forecasting

This repository presents a machine learning project focused on forecasting solar irradiance using historical and meteorological data.  
Accurate forecasting of solar irradiance is crucial for optimizing the performance of solar energy systems.

## üìò Project Overview

The Jupyter Notebook `Solar_Irradiance.ipynb` implements a predictive model for solar irradiance.  
It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## üöÄ How to Run

You can run the notebook locally or on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/):

### Option 1: Run on Google Colab

1. Open this notebook in Colab:
   - Upload the notebook to your Google Drive or GitHub, then open it via [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Make sure to upload or mount the necessary data files.
3. Run the cells top to bottom.

### Option 2: Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SudharShan13/Solar-Irradiance-Forecasting.git
   cd solar-irradiance-forecasting
   ```

2. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Solar_Irradiance.ipynb
   ```

3. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the results.

## üìä Output

The notebook includes:

- Data analysis and preprocessing
- Visualizations of features and predictions
- Model evaluation metrics

## üìå Notes

- Ensure all required Python packages are installed.
